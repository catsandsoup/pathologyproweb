# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will transform the visual design of the existing blood test tracking application to follow Apple's Human Interface Guidelines and design language, as exemplified by the Health app. The goal is to create a cohesive, polished user experience that feels native to Apple's ecosystem while preserving all existing functionality including file upload, data processing, charts, metrics display, biological sex handling, and PDF export. This is purely a visual/UI transformation that implements Apple's typography, color schemes, spacing, interaction patterns, and visual hierarchy principles.
