# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhancement adds biological sex-specific reference ranges to the blood test analysis application. The system will prompt users for their biological sex to provide more accurate reference ranges while maintaining backward compatibility with existing functionality. The enhancement includes adding new medical tests from Medscape reference values and implementing a safe, phased approach to prevent data corruption or system glitches.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Biological Sex Selection

**User Story:** As a user uploading blood test data, I want to specify my biological sex so that I can receive more accurate reference ranges for my test results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads blood test data THEN the system SHALL process the data using existing broad reference ranges initially
2. AFTER data processing is complete THEN the system SHALL display a non-intrusive prompt asking for biological sex selection
3. WHEN the user selects their biological sex THEN the system SHALL recalculate metrics using sex-specific reference ranges
4. IF the user chooses not to specify biological sex THEN the system SHALL continue using broad/combined reference ranges
5. WHEN the user closes the biological sex prompt THEN the system SHALL remember this choice for the current session

### Requirement 2: Sex Toggle Interface

**User Story:** As a user who has already loaded data, I want to switch between male/female reference ranges so that I can compare results or correct my initial selection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is loaded and biological sex is specified THEN the system SHALL display a sex toggle control in the dashboard header
2. WHEN the user clicks the sex toggle THEN the system SHALL immediately recalculate all metrics using the selected sex's reference ranges
3. WHEN toggling between sexes THEN the system SHALL update all health metric cards, trend charts, and PDF exports
4. WHEN no biological sex is specified THEN the sex toggle SHALL not be visible

### Requirement 3: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As an existing user, I want the application to continue working exactly as before if I choose not to specify my biological sex.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing functionality is used without specifying biological sex THEN the system SHALL behave identically to the previous version
2. WHEN processing uploaded files THEN the system SHALL not break or fail if biological sex is not provided
3. WHEN generating demo data THEN the system SHALL continue to work with existing demo profiles
4. WHEN exporting PDFs THEN the system SHALL work regardless of biological sex specification

### Requirement 4: Enhanced Parameter Matching

**User Story:** As a user uploading blood test files with different spellings, I want the system to correctly identify my test parameters regardless of regional spelling variations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing uploaded files THEN the system SHALL detect both "Hemoglobin" and "Haemoglobin" spellings
2. WHEN multiple spellings are detected THEN the system SHALL use the most common spelling as the canonical name
3. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL show consistent parameter names regardless of input spelling
4. WHEN matching parameters THEN the system SHALL not create duplicate entries for spelling variations

### Requirement 5: Sex-Specific Reference Ranges

**User Story:** As a user who has specified my biological sex, I want to see reference ranges that are appropriate for my sex so that I can better understand my health metrics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN biological sex is "male" THEN the system SHALL use male-specific reference ranges where available
2. WHEN biological sex is "female" THEN the system SHALL use female-specific reference ranges where available
3. WHEN sex-specific ranges are not available THEN the system SHALL fall back to broad/combined ranges
4. WHEN displaying health metric cards THEN the system SHALL indicate which reference ranges are being used
5. WHEN generating trend charts THEN the system SHALL use appropriate reference ranges for highlighting normal/abnormal values

### Requirement 6: New Medical Tests Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want access to additional medical test parameters so that I can analyze a more comprehensive set of blood work results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new tests are added THEN the system SHALL not interfere with existing test processing
2. WHEN processing uploaded files THEN the system SHALL recognize new test parameters from Medscape reference values
3. WHEN new tests are detected THEN the system SHALL categorize them appropriately (Cardiac, Coagulation, Tumor Markers, etc.)
4. WHEN displaying results THEN new tests SHALL appear in appropriate category sections
5. WHEN new tests have sex-specific ranges THEN the system SHALL apply them based on user's biological sex selection

### Requirement 7: Data Integrity and Safety

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to remain stable and reliable when new features are added so that my data analysis is not corrupted or lost.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new features are implemented THEN existing data processing SHALL not be corrupted
2. WHEN parameter matching fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle unknown parameters without crashing
3. WHEN reference ranges are missing THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate fallback behavior
4. WHEN errors occur during sex-specific processing THEN the system SHALL fall back to broad ranges
5. WHEN migrating existing parameters THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing functionality

### Requirement 8: User Experience Continuity

**User Story:** As a user, I want the new features to feel natural and integrated so that my workflow is enhanced rather than disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN biological sex prompts appear THEN they SHALL be non-intrusive and easily dismissible
2. WHEN sex toggle controls are shown THEN they SHALL be clearly labeled and intuitive to use
3. WHEN reference ranges change THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback about the change
4. WHEN new test categories are displayed THEN they SHALL follow the existing design patterns
5. WHEN using demo data THEN the biological sex features SHALL work seamlessly with existing demo profiles
